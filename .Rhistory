# Case 1 -- Assignment 3
## The effect of women's schooling on fertility
Using the same ‘General Social Survey’ data from the 1972 to 1984 US National Opinion Research Center (`case_1.dta`), you are now investigating possible nonlinearities in the relationship between education and fertility, as well as,   factors that effect the decision for women who have two or less children compared to women who have more than two children. Proceed as follows.
1. As a base specification, estimate the effect of women’s education on fertility controlling for age, race, region and type of living environment at the age of 16, and the dummy variables of the survey years. Why would you not log-transform your dependent variable?
2. Sally is a 29-year old Caucasian college graduate living in a town in the East of the United States. Molly shares all of these characteristics but lives in the South. Based on (1), test the null hypothesis that $\beta_{east} = \beta_{south}$.
3. Betsy shares the same characteristics as Sally but lives in the West. Manually construct a 95% confidence interval for the expected fertility difference between Sally and Betsy and explain the result. (Hint: you will need to create a new dummy variable.)
4. Based on (1), test the following null hypothesis with an $F$-test: $\beta_{town} = 0$. How is the resulting $F$-statistic related to the corresponding $t$-statistic in your regression output?
5. Re-estimate (1) by specifying a quadratic effect of education on fertility. Interpret the intercept and education coefficients substantively (economically) and statistically.
6. Based on (5), what is the total effect of one additional year of schooling on fertility for a black university graduate (16 years of schooling)? What about the effect of education for a 'non-black' high school graduate (12 years of schooling)? What can we conclude from this difference?
7. Re-estimate (5) using the logarithm of age instead of age itself. Evaluate the effect of age substantively (economically) and statistically.
7a. Re-estimate (5) by specifying a quadratic effect of age on fertility. Evaluate the effect of age substantively (economically) and statistically.
8. Compare the regressions in (7) and (7a). Which specification do you prefer and why?
9. Run two regressions: (i) estimate the effect of education on fertility, while also controlling for year dummies (e.g. `y74`); (ii)  estimate the effect of education on fertility, while also controlling for year dummies *and* age. Explain what happens to the coefficient of education and its standard error between regressions (i) and (ii). What is the role played here by the correlation between the two variables *education* and *age*?
10. Using a Linear Probability Model, estimate the effect of women’s education on a binary variable of kids( >2 or $\leq 2$) controlling for age, race, region and type of living environment at the age of 1. (Hint: you must generate a new binary variable). Interpret the education and age coefficients substantively (economically) and statistically.
